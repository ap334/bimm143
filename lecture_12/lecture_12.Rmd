>Q1: Download a CSV file from the PDB site (accessible from “Analyze” -> “PDB Statistics” > “by Experimental Method and Molecular Type”. Move this CSV file into your RStudio project and determine the percentage of structures solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy. Also can you determine what proportion of structures are protein? Aim to have a rendered GitHub document with working code that yields your answers.

```{r}
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1)
stats
```
```{r}
ans <- stats$Total/sum(stats$Total) *100
names(ans) <- rownames(stats)
ans
```

```{r}
sum(stats$Proteins)/sum(stats$Total) *100
```


>Q2: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?
