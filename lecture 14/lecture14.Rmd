##Analyzing RNA-seq by genotype results

Here we read the results of the RNA-Seq for about 230 people with different genotypes for the rs8067378 Asthma associated SNP. 

```{r}
genes <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
head(genes)
```

Extract the A/A rows.
```{r}
AA <- genes$geno == "A/A"
AA1 <- genes[AA, ]
AA1
mAA <- mean(AA1$exp)



GG <- genes$geno == "G/G"
GG1 <- genes[GG, ]
GG1
mGG <- mean(GG1$exp)

boxplot(exp ~ geno, data=genes)
```
